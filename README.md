# react_todo
Simple React TODO app for a basic class

# Install

Download from Github and run

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If you want auto building, at the first time is recommended to run this command for building the project

```sh
$ gulp dev
```

Is probably that you must install Gulp globally before running the last command

```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```
